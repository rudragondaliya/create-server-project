## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 💻 Getting Started

2.  **Navigate to the `MultipleFiles` directory**:

3.  **Install dependencies (if any)**:
    This project primarily uses Bootstrap via CDN, so there are no explicit `npm` dependencies for the front-end. However, the `index.js` file is a Node.js script.
